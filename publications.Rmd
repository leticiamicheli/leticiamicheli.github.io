## Under Review

**Micheli, L.**, Negrini, M., Schuhmann, T., \& Riedl, A. (2021). Brain stimulation reveals distinct motives underlying reciprocal punishment and reward.

<div style="text-align: justify"> Reciprocal punishment and reward are at the core of human societal order. Their underlying neural mechanisms are, however, not fully understood. We systemize evidence regarding the involvement of the right dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC, mPFC) in reciprocal fairness in three psychological mechanisms (cognitive control, integration-and-selection, and self-reference). We test them in a comprehensive behavioral experiment with non-invasive brain stimulation where participants can punish greedy actions and reward generous actions. Stimulation of either brain area decreases reward and punishment when reciprocation is costly but increases reward when it is non-costly. None of the hypothesized mechanisms fully accounts for the observed behavior. We propose that, for reciprocal punishment, both the rDLPFC and the mPFC process self-relevant information, in terms of both personal cost and personal involvement. For reciprocal reward, these brain regions are involved in controlling selfish and pure reciprocity motives, while simultaneously promoting the enforcement of fairness norms. The asymmetric involvement of the investigated brain areas in reciprocal punishment and reward is informative for the research on biologically plausible models of human decision-making.</div>

Azevedo, F., Marques, T., \& **Micheli, L.** (2021). In pursuit of racial equality: Identifying the determinants of support for the Black Lives Matter Movement with a systematic review and multiple meta-analyses. 

<div style="text-align: justify"> “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe” were the last words of Eric Garner and George Floyd before being murdered by those who swore to protect them. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement arose to put a much-needed spotlight on police brutality and systemic racism against Black people in the United States. In two comprehensive studies, we sought to investigate systematically the demographic, political and psychological bases of support for the BLM movement. First, we conducted a systematic review and narratively synthesized the determinants of BLM support investigated in the published literature. A total of 1590 records were identified and findings of 24 studies (Npooled=27,691) were summarized along six categories relating to demographics, race, partisanship and ideology, discrimination and prejudice, and social and psychological attitudes. Second, we exhaustively searched for determinants of BLM support across seventeen probability-based nationally representative datasets (Npooled=31,779), finding 37 common predictors for which individual meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the strength and robustness of their associations. Our results suggest that there is a near perfect match between BLM opposition and positive attitudes towards American institutions deeply rooted in systemic racism. The present work contributes to a broad categorization of correlates of BLM support across social, psychological, and political domains.</div>

Azevedo, F., **Micheli, L.**, \& Bolesta., D. S. Does Stereotype Threat contribute to the Political Knowledge Gender Gap? A Preregistered Replication Study of Ihme and Tausendpfund (2018). 

<div style="text-align: justify">The gender gap in political knowledge is a well-established finding in Political Science. One explanation for gender differences in political knowledge is the activation of negative stereotypes about women. As part of the Systematizing Confidence in Open Research and Evidence (SCORE) program, we conducted a two-stage preregistered and high-powered direct replication of Study 2 of Ihme and Tausendpfund (2018). While we successfully replicated the gender gap in political knowledge—such that male participants performed better than female participants—both the first (N=671) and second stage (N=831) of the replication of the stereotype activation effect were unsuccessful. Taken together (pooled N=1502), results indicate evidence-of-absence of the effect of stereotype activation on gender differences in political knowledge. We discuss potential explanations for these findings and put forward evidence that the gender gap in political knowledge might be an artifact of how knowledge is measured.</div>

**Micheli, L.**, Geyskens, K., Goukens, C., \& Riedl, A. More opportunities, better outcomes: Does inequality in opportunity call for outcome redistribution? 

<div style="text-align: justify">The rise of economic inequality has brought to light the debate of unequal opportunities in societies. While the demand for levelling the playing field is currently high, it is less clear how inequality in opportunity should be rectified. Here, we explore whether outcome redistribution is seen as a legitimate compensation for unequal opportunities. In doing so, we examine the behavior of both involved and non-involved individuals (i.e., stakeholders and spectators). In an experimental setting, stakeholders received either high or low chances to win a monetary prize. Before knowing who the winner was, stakeholders were asked to report how they would redistribute the monetary prize in case they were themselves the winner while spectators were asked how they would redistribute the prize in case a person with high or low chances was the winner. The source of inequality in opportunities was varied. Results show that stakeholders with higher winning chances felt more entitled to the monetary prize and redistributed less of it than stakeholders with low winning chances. Moreover, source of inequality differentially influenced ex ante redistribution of stakeholders with high and low winning chances. Spectators' ex ante redistributive decisions were neither influenced by individuals' chances nor by the source of inequality. Results are discussed in light of possible implications to redistributive policies that aim to address inequality in opportunities.</div>

**Micheli, L.**, Geyskens, K., Briers, B., \& Goukens, C. Climbing the ladder: Perceptions of high upward economic mobility increase status consumption among bottom-tier consumers. 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Beliefs in upward economic mobility are prevalent in many societies and especially pervasive among the poor. This research focuses on bottom-tier consumers—and examines how beliefs in upward mobility affect status seeking and the likelihood to engage in conspicuous consumption. Because perceptions of high economic mobility enhance the perceived legitimacy of inequality and thus the credibility of status goods, bottom-tier consumers are expected to become more prone to signal their status under high rather than low economic mobility. Four studies provide evidence for this hypothesis across various measures of status consumption and show the underlying process through perceived legitimacy of inequality. The effect of perceptions of upward mobility on preference for status consumption is independent of the perceived level of economic inequality and only present when income is not directly observable, suggesting that status consumption is used to signal one’s income. The present research sheds light on the importance of investigating societal perceptions among the poor to understand consumer behavior and offers implications for policy making.</div>
