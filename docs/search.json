      "contents": "\r\n\r\nGrowing up in a very unequal country like Brazil, I was always confronted with the enormous differences between the things I owned and the opportunities my parents could afford me and the way children in the slums (just a few blocks away from where I lived) were growing up. When I later migrated to Europe to pursue my masters degree, I was exposed to a whole new world and I was amazed to see how everything worked so differently: the sense of security people had walking down the street, how much a work-life balance was valued, how differently people consumed and used status goods and so on. It may well be this was just my own perception, but the experience of living abroad in less unequal countries definitely informed my understanding on how inequality might shape the way we live, think and behave.\r\nDuring my PhD, I had the chance to turn some of my own perceptions and experiences into research questions. Specifically, I wanted to investigate the impact of inequality and unfairness on decisions made in the context of social interactions. Using a multi-method approach, I investigated how people perceive different sources of inequality of opportunity, how having more or less opportunities influence people’s preferences for redistribution, the effect of perceptions of economic mobility on status consumption and the neural mechanisms associated with the enforcement of fairness norms. If you are interested in learning more about the research I did during my PhD, you can find below the link to my thesis and the video of my defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ University Repository]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole PhD journey made me reflect several times on the way things were back home. So, when it was time to wrap up the thesis, I felt it would not be complete without representing inequality through the eyes of those most affected by it. I then reached out to an association in Brazil who tends to underprivileged children living in the slums (the one close to where I grew up). Together with the children, they developed a class assignment where children drew what inequality means to them. The results of this activity were these beautiful and touching drawings below, which I included (with their permission) in my thesis as illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I admire so much about this association is that it offers children opportunities they wouldn’t otherwise have access to, given their families socioeconomic background. The children who are assisted visit this association daily, and are offered educational support, English, music and computer classes, psychological assistance and meals. With the help of my family, friends, colleagues and the wonderful academic community on Twitter, we were able to raise some funds, which were used to provide these kids with a Christmas celebration and brand new school materials for the academic year of 2022. You can see pictures of their Christmas celebration below (shared with their permission).\r\nThank you so much to everyone who helped! And if you would still like to help out this association, you can always do so through this page here, which is a reliable Brazilian crowdfunding page. I am sure your help will be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Copyright &copy 2022, Leticia Micheli. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Golden gazes: Gaze direction and emotional context promote prosocial behavior by increasing attributions of empathy and perspective-taking (Preregistration)\r\n\r\nProsocial behavior is fundamental to societies. But when and towards whom do humans act generously? We investigate the impact of a conversation partner’s gaze direction and the emotional context on (i) perceptions of their social cognition skills and (ii) prosocial decisions towards them. In three experiments (two preregistered, N = 486), participants witnessed pre-recorded video conversations between a listener (visible) and a speaker (audible, not visible). The listener either established eye contact, averted gaze or showed a mixed gaze pattern (gaze direction) while the speaker told a neutral or negatively-valenced autobiographic episode (emotional context). Participants rated the listener’s empathy and perspective-taking after each video and played the Trust Game (study 1) or the Dictator Game (study 2) with the listener. Replicating previous findings, occasional gaze avoidance, especially during negative narrations, increased attributions of social understanding to the listener. Critically, mediation analyses revealed that listeners perceived as empathic and taking perspective were ultimately treated with more trust and generosity in strategic and non-strategic economic games, suggesting that social signals and contextual cues can serve as an indication of another’s reputation, thereby promoting indirect reciprocity. Lastly, in study 3, we show that emotional context, but not listeners’ gaze behavior, promoted the spread of generosity towards anonymous, previously unobserved individuals in a Dictator Game, driven by social cognition skills attributed to the listener. We conclude that social signals and contextual cues can be important drivers of cooperation in societies via mechanisms such as indirect reciprocity and social contagion of generosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicheli, L., & Schumacher, A. Anticipated scarcity and stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of perceived threat, childhood SES and materialism.\r\n\r\nPrevious research has shown that perceived existential threat experienced during or shortly after the first wave of the global COVID-19 pandemic, engendered anticipated scarcity and stockpiling behavior. However, the relationship between anticipated scarcity and stockpiling may not hold unambiguously for everyone. Across two exploratory and one preregistered study (N=644), we show that perceived threat of COVID-19 is associated with stockpiling tendencies by increasing the anticipation of product scarcity – a resource threat. The association between anticipated product scarcity and stockpiling depends, however, on childhood socio-economic status (SES) and materialism. For individuals with low childhood SES, the anticipation of product scarcity was only associated with stockpiling among those who valued materialism. Individuals with high childhood SES, by contrast, stockpiled in response to anticipated scarcity regardless of their level of materialism. Our findings qualify previous literature on the association between perceived threat of COVID-19, anticipated scarcity and stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic and help reconcile contradictory predictions about the role of childhood SES in individuals’ consumption behavior in response to adversity.\r\n\r\nIn Preparation\r\nMicheli, L., Geyskens, K., Goukens, C., & Riedl, A. More opportunities, better outcomes: Does inequality in opportunity call for outcome redistribution?\r\n\r\nThe rise of economic inequality has brought to light the debate of unequal opportunities in societies. While the demand for levelling the playing field is currently high, it is less clear how inequality in opportunity should be rectified. Here, we explore whether outcome redistribution is seen as a legitimate compensation for unequal opportunities. In doing so, we examine the behavior of both involved and non-involved individuals (i.e., stakeholders and spectators). In an experimental setting, stakeholders received either high or low chances to win a monetary prize. Before knowing who the winner was, stakeholders were asked to report how they would redistribute the monetary prize in case they were themselves the winner while spectators were asked how they would redistribute the prize in case a person with high or low chances was the winner. The source of inequality in opportunities was varied. Results show that stakeholders with higher winning chances felt more entitled to the monetary prize and redistributed less of it than stakeholders with low winning chances. Moreover, source of inequality differentially influenced ex ante redistribution of stakeholders with high and low winning chances. Spectators’ ex ante redistributive decisions were neither influenced by individuals’ chances nor by the source of inequality. Results are discussed in light of possible implications to redistributive policies that aim to address inequality in opportunities.\r\n\r\nMicheli, L., Geyskens, K., Briers, B., & Goukens, C. Climbing the ladder: Perceptions of high upward economic mobility increase status consumption among bottom-tier consumers.\r\n\r\nBeliefs in upward economic mobility are prevalent in many societies and especially pervasive among the poor. This research focuses on bottom-tier consumers—and examines how beliefs in upward mobility affect status seeking and the likelihood to engage in conspicuous consumption. Because perceptions of high economic mobility enhance the perceived legitimacy of inequality and thus the credibility of status goods, bottom-tier consumers are expected to become more prone to signal their status under high rather than low economic mobility. Four studies provide evidence for this hypothesis across various measures of status consumption and show the underlying process through perceived legitimacy of inequality. The effect of perceptions of upward mobility on preference for status consumption is independent of the perceived level of economic inequality and only present when income is not directly observable, suggesting that status consumption is used to signal one’s income. The present research sheds light on the importance of investigating societal perceptions among the poor to understand consumer behavior and offers implications for policy making.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork in Progress\r\nMicheli, L., & Böckler, A.

The way we interact with each other, in turn, can definitely play a role in mitigating or intensifying inequality in our surroundings. In my main line of research, I investigate how contexts of inequality, unfairness and scarcity impact our decisions when interacting with others. I am primarily interested in understanding how these challenging contexts influence social and consumer decision-making and what are the neural mechanisms underlying such decisions. Specifically, I investigate how different types of inequality (e.g., inequality in outcomes or inequality in opportunities) affect our decisions, and how individuals think situations of unfairness should be addressed. I am also interested in understanding how individuals’ perceptions of inequality and economic mobility influence their decisions.\r\nSelected Publications and Projects:\r\nHuijsmans, I., Ma, I., Micheli, L., Civai, C., Stallen, M., & Sanfey, A.G.

In addition, individual differences in psychological needs and ideology can lead to important cleavages in how people perceive and deal with inequality and unfairness. I am interested in investigating how inequality affects psychological processes such as attribution of individual responsibility, hope and creativity, and in the role of individual differences in confronting social inequality.\r\nSelected Publications and Projects:\r\nMicheli, L. & Gagnon, N.

But how do people decide when and with whom to cooperate? Understanding how cooperation emerges and is sustained in groups is especially important in light of emerging societal issues such as health and climate crises, which require a large share of the population to cooperate and adhere to certain rules. I am interested in understanding the neural mechanisms and underlying psychological motivations of our behavior towards others. Some of the questions that I try to answer in this line of research are: What is the role of external incentives in promoting cooperation? How situations of uncertainty influence social decision-making? And how our perception of others’ behavior and social cognition affects how nice we are towards them?\r\nSelected Publications and Projects:\r\nMicheli, L., Stallen, M., & Sanfey, A.G. (2021).

Whenever I can, I try to get involved in replications and Team Science projects, which are a new and fun way to do science collaboratively leveraging the expertise and resources of a large (and often multidisciplinary!) team of researchers. Since I am involved with the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT), I am particularly interested in helping develop Open Educational Resources that facilitate the teaching of Open Scholarship practices.
