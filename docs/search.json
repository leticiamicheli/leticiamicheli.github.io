      "contents": "\r\n\r\nGrowing up in a very unequal country like Brazil, I was always\r\nconfronted with the enormous differences between the things I owned and\r\nthe opportunities my parents could afford me and the way children in the\r\nslums (just a few blocks away from where I lived) were growing up. When\r\nI later migrated to Europe to pursue my masters degree, I was exposed to\r\na whole new world and I was amazed to see how everything worked so\r\ndifferently: the sense of security people had walking down the street,\r\nhow much a work-life balance was valued, how differently people consumed\r\nand used status goods and so on. It may well be this was just my own\r\nperception, but the experience of living abroad in less unequal\r\ncountries definitely informed my understanding on how inequality might\r\nshape the way we live, think and behave.\r\nDuring my PhD, I had the chance to turn some of my own perceptions and\r\nexperiences into research questions. Specifically, I wanted to\r\ninvestigate the impact of inequality and unfairness on decisions made in\r\nthe context of social interactions. Using a multi-method approach, I\r\ninvestigated how people perceive different sources of inequality of\r\nopportunity, how having more or less opportunities influence people’s\r\npreferences for redistribution, the effect of perceptions of economic\r\nmobility on status consumption and the neural mechanisms associated with\r\nthe enforcement of fairness norms. If you are interested in learning\r\nmore about the research I did during my PhD, you can find below the link\r\nto my thesis and the video of my defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ University\r\nRepository]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole PhD journey made me reflect several times on the way things\r\nwere back home. So, when it was time to wrap up the thesis, I felt it\r\nwould not be complete without representing inequality through the eyes\r\nof those most affected by it. I then reached out to an association in\r\nBrazil who tends to underprivileged children living in the slums (the\r\none close to where I grew up). Together with the children, they\r\ndeveloped a class assignment where children drew what inequality means\r\nto them. The results of this activity were these beautiful and touching\r\ndrawings below, which I included (with their permission) in my thesis as\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"path\":[\"images/fig01.png\",\"images/fig02.png\",\"images/fig03.png\",\"images/fig04.png\",\"images/fig05.png\",\"images/fig06.png\"],\"caption\":[],\"dim\":\"200px\",\"gap\":\"10px\",\"type\":\"grid\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\r\n\r\nWhat I admire so much about this association is that it offers\r\nchildren opportunities they wouldn’t otherwise have access to, given\r\ntheir families socioeconomic background. The children who are assisted\r\nvisit this association daily, and are offered educational support,\r\nEnglish, music and computer classes, psychological assistance and meals.\r\nWith the help of my family, friends, colleagues and the wonderful\r\nacademic community on Twitter, we were able to raise some funds, which\r\nwere used to provide these kids with a Christmas celebration and brand\r\nnew school materials for the academic year of 2022. You can see pictures\r\nof their Christmas celebration below (shared with their permission).\r\nThank you so much to everyone who helped! And if you would still like\r\nto help out this association, you can always do so through this page here, which is a reliable Brazilian\r\ncrowdfunding page. I am sure your help will be very much\r\nappreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"path\":[\"img/fig01.jpeg\",\"img/fig02.jpeg\",\"img/fig03.jpeg\",\"img/fig04.jpeg\",\"img/fig05.jpeg\",\"img/fig06.jpeg\",\"img/fig07.jpeg\",\"img/fig08.jpeg\",\"img/fig09.jpeg\"],\"caption\":[],\"dim\":\"200px\",\"gap\":\"6px\",\"type\":\"grid\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Copyright &copy 2022, Leticia Micheli. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Golden\r\ngazes: Gaze direction and emotional context promote prosocial behavior\r\nby increasing attributions of empathy and perspective-taking (Preregistration)\r\n\r\nProsocial behavior is fundamental to societies. But when and towards\r\nwhom do humans act generously? We investigate the impact of a\r\nconversation partner’s gaze direction and the emotional context on (i)\r\nperceptions of their social cognition skills and (ii) prosocial\r\ndecisions towards them. In three experiments (two preregistered, N =\r\n486), participants witnessed pre-recorded video conversations between a\r\nlistener (visible) and a speaker (audible, not visible). The listener\r\neither established eye contact, averted gaze or showed a mixed gaze\r\npattern (gaze direction) while the speaker told a neutral or\r\nnegatively-valenced autobiographic episode (emotional context).\r\nParticipants rated the listener’s empathy and perspective-taking after\r\neach video and played the Trust Game (study 1) or the Dictator Game\r\n(study 2) with the listener. Replicating previous findings, occasional\r\ngaze avoidance, especially during negative narrations, increased\r\nattributions of social understanding to the listener. Critically,\r\nmediation analyses revealed that listeners perceived as empathic and\r\ntaking perspective were ultimately treated with more trust and\r\ngenerosity in strategic and non-strategic economic games, suggesting\r\nthat social signals and contextual cues can serve as an indication of\r\nanother’s reputation, thereby promoting indirect reciprocity. Lastly, in\r\nstudy 3, we show that emotional context, but not listeners’ gaze\r\nbehavior, promoted the spread of generosity towards anonymous,\r\npreviously unobserved individuals in a Dictator Game, driven by social\r\ncognition skills attributed to the listener. We conclude that social\r\nsignals and contextual cues can be important drivers of cooperation in\r\nsocieties via mechanisms such as indirect reciprocity and social\r\ncontagion of generosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicheli, L., & Schumacher, A. Anticipated\r\nscarcity and stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of\r\nperceived threat, childhood SES and materialism.\r\n\r\nPrevious research has shown that perceived existential threat\r\nexperienced during or shortly after the first wave of the global\r\nCOVID-19 pandemic, engendered anticipated scarcity and stockpiling\r\nbehavior. However, the relationship between anticipated scarcity and\r\nstockpiling may not hold unambiguously for everyone. Across two\r\nexploratory and one preregistered study (N=644), we show that perceived\r\nthreat of COVID-19 is associated with stockpiling tendencies by\r\nincreasing the anticipation of product scarcity – a resource threat. The\r\nassociation between anticipated product scarcity and stockpiling\r\ndepends, however, on childhood socio-economic status (SES) and\r\nmaterialism. For individuals with low childhood SES, the anticipation of\r\nproduct scarcity was only associated with stockpiling among those who\r\nvalued materialism. Individuals with high childhood SES, by contrast,\r\nstockpiled in response to anticipated scarcity regardless of their level\r\nof materialism. Our findings qualify previous literature on the\r\nassociation between perceived threat of COVID-19, anticipated scarcity\r\nand stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic and help reconcile\r\ncontradictory predictions about the role of childhood SES in\r\nindividuals’ consumption behavior in response to adversity.\r\n\r\nIn Preparation\r\nMicheli, L., Geyskens, K., Goukens, C., & Riedl,\r\nA. More opportunities, better outcomes: Does inequality in opportunity\r\ncall for outcome redistribution?\r\n\r\nThe rise of economic inequality has brought to light the debate of\r\nunequal opportunities in societies. While the demand for levelling the\r\nplaying field is currently high, it is less clear how inequality in\r\nopportunity should be rectified. Here, we explore whether outcome\r\nredistribution is seen as a legitimate compensation for unequal\r\nopportunities. In doing so, we examine the behavior of both involved and\r\nnon-involved individuals (i.e., stakeholders and spectators). In an\r\nexperimental setting, stakeholders received either high or low chances\r\nto win a monetary prize. Before knowing who the winner was, stakeholders\r\nwere asked to report how they would redistribute the monetary prize in\r\ncase they were themselves the winner while spectators were asked how\r\nthey would redistribute the prize in case a person with high or low\r\nchances was the winner. The source of inequality in opportunities was\r\nvaried. Results show that stakeholders with higher winning chances felt\r\nmore entitled to the monetary prize and redistributed less of it than\r\nstakeholders with low winning chances. Moreover, source of inequality\r\ndifferentially influenced ex ante redistribution of stakeholders with\r\nhigh and low winning chances. Spectators’ ex ante redistributive\r\ndecisions were neither influenced by individuals’ chances nor by the\r\nsource of inequality. Results are discussed in light of possible\r\nimplications to redistributive policies that aim to address inequality\r\nin opportunities.\r\n\r\nMicheli, L., Geyskens, K., Briers, B., &\r\nGoukens, C. Climbing the ladder: Perceptions of high upward economic\r\nmobility increase status consumption among bottom-tier consumers.\r\n\r\nBeliefs in upward economic mobility are prevalent in many societies and\r\nespecially pervasive among the poor. This research focuses on\r\nbottom-tier consumers—and examines how beliefs in upward mobility affect\r\nstatus seeking and the likelihood to engage in conspicuous consumption.\r\nBecause perceptions of high economic mobility enhance the perceived\r\nlegitimacy of inequality and thus the credibility of status goods,\r\nbottom-tier consumers are expected to become more prone to signal their\r\nstatus under high rather than low economic mobility. Four studies\r\nprovide evidence for this hypothesis across various measures of status\r\nconsumption and show the underlying process through perceived legitimacy\r\nof inequality. The effect of perceptions of upward mobility on\r\npreference for status consumption is independent of the perceived level\r\nof economic inequality and only present when income is not directly\r\nobservable, suggesting that status consumption is used to signal one’s\r\nincome. The present research sheds light on the importance of\r\ninvestigating societal perceptions among the poor to understand consumer\r\nbehavior and offers implications for policy making.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork in Progress\r\nMicheli, L., & Böckler, A.

The way we interact\r\nwith each other, in turn, can definitely play a role in mitigating or\r\nintensifying inequality in our surroundings. In my main line of\r\nresearch, I investigate how contexts of inequality, unfairness and\r\nscarcity impact our decisions when interacting with others. I am\r\nprimarily interested in understanding how these challenging contexts\r\ninfluence social and consumer decision-making and what are the neural\r\nmechanisms underlying such decisions. Specifically, I investigate how\r\ndifferent types of inequality (e.g., inequality in outcomes or\r\ninequality in opportunities) affect our decisions, and how individuals\r\nthink situations of unfairness should be addressed. I am also interested\r\nin understanding how individuals’ perceptions of inequality and economic\r\nmobility influence their decisions.\r\nSelected Publications and Projects:\r\nHuijsmans, I., Ma, I., Micheli, L., Civai, C., Stallen, M., &\r\nSanfey, A.G.

In\r\naddition, individual differences in psychological needs and ideology can\r\nlead to important cleavages in how people perceive and deal with\r\ninequality and unfairness. I am interested in investigating how\r\ninequality affects psychological processes such as attribution of\r\nindividual responsibility, hope and creativity, and in the role of\r\nindividual differences in confronting social inequality.\r\nSelected Publications and Projects:\r\nMicheli, L. & Gagnon, N.

But how do people decide when and\r\nwith whom to cooperate? Understanding how cooperation emerges and is\r\nsustained in groups is especially important in light of emerging\r\nsocietal issues such as health and climate crises, which require a large\r\nshare of the population to cooperate and adhere to certain rules. I am\r\ninterested in understanding the neural mechanisms and underlying\r\npsychological motivations of our behavior towards others. Some of the\r\nquestions that I try to answer in this line of research are: What is the\r\nrole of external incentives in promoting cooperation? How situations of\r\nuncertainty influence social decision-making? And how our perception of\r\nothers’ behavior and social cognition affects how nice we are towards\r\nthem?\r\nSelected Publications and Projects:\r\nMicheli, L., Stallen, M., & Sanfey, A.G. (2021).
