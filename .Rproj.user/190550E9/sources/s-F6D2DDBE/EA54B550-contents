## Bio

I am a psychologist trained in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroeconomics. I am mainly interested in 
investigating how situations of *inequality, unfairness and scarcity* influence our psychology as well as our social and consumer decision-making. In my research, I adopt an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach, using insights and methods from Psychology, Economics and Neuroscience. I am also striving to adopt open scholarship into my own work. Since 2020, I am a community manager at the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training [(FORRT)](https://forrt.org/). 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Psychology, WÃ¼rzburg University, in Germany](https://www.psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/social-cognition/startseite/).
