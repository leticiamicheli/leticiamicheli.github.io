## Bio

I am a psychologist trained in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroeconomics.   
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Psychology, WÃ¼rzburg University, in Germany.

In my research, I am mainly interested in investigating how situations of 
*inequality, unfairness and scarcity*   
influence our psychology as well our social and consumer decision-making.   
I adopt an interdisciplinary approach and use insights and methods 
from Psychology, Economics and Neuroscience.   

I am also committed to progressively adopt open scholarship
into my own work. Since 2020, I am a community manager at the Framework for 
Open and Reproducible Research Training [(FORRT)](https://forrt.org/).
