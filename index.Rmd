## Bio
<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a psychologist trained in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroeconomics. I am mainly interested in 
investigating how situations of *inequality, unfairness and scarcity* influence our psychology as well as our social and consumer decision-making. In my research, I adopt an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach, using insights and methods from Psychology, Economics and Neuroscience.   

I am also striving to adopt open scholarship into my own work. I am a community manager at the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training [(FORRT)](https://forrt.org/) and an ambassador for the [Center of Open Science](https://www.cos.io/communities/ambassadors#:~:text=Building%20a%20Network%20of%20Open,community%20with%20tools%20for%20change.). 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Psychology, WÃ¼rzburg University, in Germany](https://www.psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/social-cognition/startseite/). </div>
