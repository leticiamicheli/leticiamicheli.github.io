## Bio
<div style="text-align: justify">
I am an Assistant Professor of Social, Economic & Organisational Psychology at [Leiden University, The Netherlands](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/social-behavioural-sciences/psychology/social-economic-and-organisational-psychology).

In my research I investigate how situations of *inequality, unfairness and scarcity* influence our psychology as well as our social and consumer decision-making. I adopt an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach, using insights and methods from Psychology, Economics and Neuroscience.   

I am also striving to adopt open scholarship into my own work. I am a community manager at the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training [(FORRT)](https://forrt.org/) and an ambassador for the [Center of Open Science](https://www.cos.io/communities/ambassadors#:~:text=Building%20a%20Network%20of%20Open,community%20with%20tools%20for%20change.).
